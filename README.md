# 🛫 Airlines Management – Data Curation, Wrangling, Cleansing & Predictive Analytics

### 🧩 Domain: Aviation / Transportation Analytics  
### 📈 Difficulty: Very High  
### 🎯 Use Case: Clean and unify passenger, booking, and flight data for predictive modeling and operational insights.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines, offering high-quality air transportation services.  
However, due to factors such as **stricter environmental regulations, rising fuel prices, higher taxes, and increased labor costs**, profitability is under pressure.  

The objective of this project is to perform an in-depth **data curation and predictive analytics study** on the company’s databases to identify patterns and **increase occupancy rates**, optimize revenues, and improve flight operational efficiency.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Clean and standardize** data from multiple operational systems (flights, bookings, passengers).  
2. **Ensure data quality** through validation, cleansing, and schema alignment.  
3. **Unify datasets** into a consistent model for predictive and descriptive analytics.  
4. **Predict key outcomes:**
   - Flight delays
   - Passenger no-shows
   - Revenue optimization  
5. **Develop actionable insights** to improve flight occupancy and reduce operational inefficiencies.

## 🧩 Datasets Overview

**Data Sources:**
- `passengers.xlsx`
- `bookings.xlsx`
- `flights.xlsx`
- `aircraft.xlsx`
- `routes.xlsx`
- `employees.xlsx`

**Data Description:**
| Dataset | Description | Key Fields |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Passengers** | Passenger profile and demographics | `passenger_id`, `gender`, `age`, `frequent_flyer` |
| **Bookings** | Ticketing and payment details | `booking_id`, `passenger_id`, `flight_id`, `fare_paid`, `booking_date` |
| **Flights** | Flight schedule and performance | `flight_id`, `aircraft_id`, `route_id`, `departure_time`, `arrival_time`, `delay_minutes` |
| **Aircraft** | Fleet details and specifications | `aircraft_id`, `type`, `capacity`, `status` |
| **Routes** | Origin-destination route information | `route_id`, `source_city`, `destination_city`, `distance_km` |
| **Employees** | Flight crew and staff information | `employee_id`, `assigned_flight`, `role`, `hours_worked` |

## 🧭 KPIs Defined

- ✈️ **Delay Rate:** % of delayed flights per route or aircraft type  
- 👥 **Occupancy Rate:** Seats occupied vs total seats  
- 💰 **Average Revenue per Flight:** Total revenue ÷ number of flights  
- 🔁 **Passenger Loyalty Index:** Number of repeated bookings per passenger  

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 🟦 1. Understand Business Context
- Predict factors influencing **flight delays, no-shows, and revenue**.  
- Define KPIs: *Delay Rate, Occupancy Rate, Average Revenue per Flight*.  
- Align project goals with **revenue optimization and customer behavior analysis**.

---

### 🟨 2. Data Discovery and Ingestion
- Datasets: `passengers`, `bookings`, `flights`, `aircraft`, `routes`, `employees`  
- Tools: `pandas.read_excel()`, `SQL import`  
- Record metadata: sheet names, row counts, timestamp ranges  

---

### 🟩 3. Data Profiling
- Tools: `pandas-profiling`, `Sweetviz`, `describe()`  
- Detect nulls, duplicates, and outliers (e.g., unrealistic ticket prices, 0 kg baggage)  
- Validate data types and formats  

---

### 🟥 4. Schema Alignment & Standardization
- Normalize column names to `snake_case`  
- Standardize date formats (ISO 8601)  
- Recode categorical fields (gender, seat_class, checkin_status)  
- Clean inconsistent city and route names  

---

### 🟪 5. Data Cleaning
- Impute missing ticket prices by average per class  
- Drop duplicate bookings and retired aircraft  
- Fix incorrect booking dates (e.g., after departure)  
- Remove anomalies (e.g., baggage > 50 kg)  

---

### 🟫 6. Data Integration and Merging
- Join `bookings + passengers + flights`  
- Merge `flights` with `routes` and `aircraft`  
- Join `employees` via `assigned_flight`  
- Validate all foreign keys — ensure no orphan records  

---

### 🟦 7. Data Transformation
- Derive new features:
  - `flight_delay_flag`
  - `passenger_age`
  - `flight_revenue`
  - `booking_lead_time = departure_date - booking_date`  
- Aggregate metrics:
  - Flight occupancy rate  
  - Passenger loyalty index  
  - Employee flight hours  

---

### 🟨 8. Data Validation & Quality Checks
- Validate consistency of flight and passenger IDs  
- Flag any future-dated bookings  
- Write data tests using `pytest` or Pandas assertions  

---

### 🟩 9. Documentation
- Build a **Data Dictionary**  
- Include transformation logs, null statistics, and sample records  
- Annotate Jupyter cells for clarity  

---

### 🟥 10. Export & Delivery
- Export cleaned datasets (`.csv` or `.xlsx`)  
- Generate model-ready data  
- Include profiling report, validation logs, and final README  

---

## 🤖 Predictive Analytics Tasks

### 🔹 **Regression Task**
**Goal:** Predict total fare paid (`fare_paid`)  
- Models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso  
- Features: `seat_class`, `baggage_kg`, `booking_lead_time`, `frequent_flyer`, `flight_duration`  
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²  

---

### 🔹 **Association Rule Mining**
**Goal:** Identify passenger behavior patterns (no-shows, cancellations)  
- Technique: Apriori / FP-Growth  
- Example Rule:  
  > IF seat_class = Economy AND baggage_kg < 10 → higher chance of no-show  

---

### 🔹 **Decision Tree Classification**
**Goal:** Predict passenger **no-show probability** (`checkin_status = 'No Show'`)  
- Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost  
- Features: `passenger_age`, `seat_class`, `frequent_flyer`, `booking_lead_time`  
- Metrics: Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score, AUC  
- Outputs: Confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance  

---

## 🚧 Main Challenges

1. Inconsistent data formats and naming conventions across sheets.  
2. Missing or incorrect booking and flight timestamps.  
3. Redundant or orphaned records (e.g., missing route IDs).  
4. Data imbalance in delay/no-show classification.  
5. Large dataset size — requiring efficient memory handling.
